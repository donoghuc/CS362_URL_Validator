## group collaboration and exploration for final project

### SETUP and INSTALL
1. clone repo
2. add junit and hamcrest to build path (```File > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries```)

### Run 
- I generated URLS_FROM_PASSING_TEST.txt by dumping output from URLValidatorCorrect/test/URLValidatorTest.java to text file in eclipse.

- I wrote the class URLValidatorInCorrect/test/regex_investigation to see the effect of the regex bug. The results are in REGEX_INVESTIGATION_OUT.txt
